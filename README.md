Educational Project 

Very simple (...but usefull to understand the IP hierarchy) implementation of an AXI bus connected IP, in VHDL code (VIVADO 2018.2 IDE and 
related SDK), in Xilinx Zinq 7000 SoC (FPGA and double dual-core ARM cortex A9) based board.

Basic example of blink led without FPGA, only with processor 0 and C script in SDK (exporting hardwarare in Vivado, using board support package)

VHDL script:

- AND LOGIC GATE: two input pin to one output pin connected with a on board led in vivado constrains setup: 
define entity (Port) and architecture (begin) field in sub IP module,
defined entity (Port), architecture (component, begin with instantiation of sub IP and port map) field in main IP module,
AXI sub IP autogenerated and instantiated;

- 8 BIT COUNTER: on rising edge of internal defined process increment value of a 24 bit std_logic_vector, when overflow increment a secondary
8 bit std_logic_vector connected with eight on board led in vivado constrains setup:
define entity (Port) and architecture (signal, begin and process) field in sub IP module,
defined entity (Port), architecture (component, begin with instantiation of sub IP and port map) and begin field in main IP module,
AXI sub IP autogenerated and instantiated;

C script:

- Turn on the eight led concurrently using board support package (bsp) application programming interface (API).
